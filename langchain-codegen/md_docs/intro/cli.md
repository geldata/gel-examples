# The CLI

The gel command line tool is an integral part of the developer workflow of building with Gel. Below are instructions for installing it.

## Installation

To get started with Gel, the first step is install the gel CLI.

Linux or macOS

```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://www.geldata.com/sh | sh
```

Windows Powershell

Gel on Windows requires WSL 2 because the Gel server runs on Linux.

```powershell
PS> iwr https://www.geldata.com/ps1 -useb | iex
```

Follow the prompts on screen to complete the installation. The script will download the gel command built for your OS and add a path to it to your shell environment. Then test the installation:

```bash
$ gel --version
Gel CLI x.x+abcdefg
```

If you encounter a command not found error, you may need to open a fresh shell window.

## See 

The entire CLI is self-documenting. Once itâ€™s installed, run gel --help to see a breakdown of all the commands and options.

```bash
$ gel --help
Usage: gel [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  <list of commands>

Options:
  <list of options>

Connection Options (gel --help-connect to see full list):
  <list of connection options>

Cloud Connection Options:
  <list of cloud connection options>
```

The majority of CLI commands perform some action against a particular Gel instance. As such, there are a standard set of flags that are used to specify which instance should be the target of the command, plus additional information like TLS certificates. The following command documents these flags.

```bash
$ gel --help-connect
Connection Options (full list):

  -I, --instance <INSTANCE>
          Instance name (use `gel instance list` to list local, remote and
          Cloud instances available to you)

      --dsn <DSN>
          DSN for Gel to connect to (overrides all other options except
          password)

      --credentials-file <CREDENTIALS_FILE>
          Path to JSON file to read credentials from

  -H, --host <HOST>
          Gel instance host

  -P, --port <PORT>
          Port to connect to Gel

      --unix-path <UNIX_PATH>
          A path to a Unix socket for Gel connection

          When the supplied path is a directory, the actual path will be
          computed using the `--port` and `--admin` parameters.
  ...
```

If you ever want to see documentation for a particular command ( gel migration create) or group of commands (gel instance), just append the --help flag.

```bash
$ gel instance --help
Manage local Gel instances

Usage: gel instance <COMMAND>

Commands:
  create          Initialize a new Gel instance
  list            Show all instances
  status          Show status of an instance
  start           Start an instance
  stop            Stop an instance
  ...
```
