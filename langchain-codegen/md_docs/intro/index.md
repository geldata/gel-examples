# Get Started

Gel is a next-generation graph-relational database designed as a spiritual successor to the relational database.

It inherits the strengths of SQL databases: type safety, performance, reliability, and transactionality. But instead of modeling data in a relational (tabular) way, Gel represents data with object types containing properties and links to other objects. It leverages this object-oriented model to provide a superpowered query language that solves some of SQL’s biggest usability problems.

## How to read the docs

Gel is a complex system, but we’ve structured the documentation so you can learn it in “phases”. You only need to learn as much as you need to start building your application.

## Tooling

To actually build apps with Gel, you’ll need to know more than SDL and EdgeQL.

Gel features:

Gel is not a graph database: the data is stored and queried using relational database techniques.  Unlike most graph databases, Gel maintains a strict schema.

Gel is not a document database, but inserting and querying hierarchical document-like data is trivial.

Gel is not a traditional object database, despite the classification, it is not an implementation of OOP persistence.
