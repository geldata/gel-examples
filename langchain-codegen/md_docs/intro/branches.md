# Branches

Gel‚Äôs branches make it easy to prototype app features that impact your database schema, even in cases where those features are never released. You can create a branch in your Gel database that corresponds to a feature branch in your VCS. When you‚Äôre done, either merge that branch into your main branch or drop it leaving your original schema intact.

The procedure we will describe should be adaptable to any VCS offering branching and rebasing, but in order to make the examples concrete and easy-to-follow, we‚Äôll be demonstrating how Gel branches interact with Git branches. You may adapt these examples to your VCS of choice.

## 1. Create a new feature branch

Create a feature branch in your VCS and switch to it. Then, create and switch to a corresponding branch in Gel using the CLI.

```bash
$ gel branch create feature
Creating branch 'feature'...
OK: CREATE BRANCH
$ gel branch switch feature
Switching from 'main' to 'feature'
```

You can alternatively create and switch in one shot using gel branch switch -c feature.

## 2. Build your feature

Write your code and make any schema changes your feature requires.

## 3. Pull any changes on ‚Äúmain‚Äù

This step is optional. If you know your main code branch is current and all migrations in that code branch have already been applied to your main database branch, feel free to skip it.

We need to make sure that merging our feature branch onto main is a simple fast-forward. The next two steps take care of that.

Switch back to your main code branch. Run git pull to pull down any new changes. If any of these are schema changes, use gel branch switch main to switch back to your main database branch and apply the new schema with gel migrate.

Once this is done, you can switch back to your feature branches in your VCS and Gel.

## 4. Rebase your feature branch on ‚Äúmain‚Äù

If you skipped the previous step, you can skip this one too. This is only necessary if you had to pull down new changes on main.

For your code branch, first make sure you‚Äôre on feature and then run the rebase:

```bash
$ git rebase main
```

Now, do the same for your database, also from feature:

```bash
$ gel branch rebase main
```

## 5. Merge 

Switch back to both main branches and merge feature.

```bash
$ git switch main
<changes>
Switched to branch 'main'
$ git merge feature
```

```bash
$ gel branch switch main
Switching from 'feature' to 'main'
$ gel branch merge feature
```

Now, your feature and its schema have been successfully merged! üéâ
