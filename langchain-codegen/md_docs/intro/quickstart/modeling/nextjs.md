# Modeling the data

The flashcards application has a simple data model, but it‚Äôs interesting enough to utilize many unique features of the Gel schema language.

Looking at the mock data in the example JSON file ./deck-edgeql.json, you can see this structure in the JSON. There is a Card type that describes a single flashcard, which contains two required string properties: front and back. Each Deck object has zero or more Card objects in an array.

```typescript
interface Card {
  front: string;
  back: string;
}

interface Deck {
  name: string;
  description: string | null;
  cards: Card[];
}
```

Starting with this simple model, add these types to the dbschema/default.gel schema file. As you can see, the types closely mirror the JSON mock data.

Also of note, the link between Card and Deck objects creates a ‚Äú1-to-n‚Äù relationship, where each Deck object has a link to zero or more Card objects. When you query the Deck.cards link, the cards will be unordered, so the Card type needs an explicit order property to allow sorting them at query time.

By default, when you try to delete an object that is linked to another object, the database will prevent you from doing so. We want to support removing a Card, so we define a deletion policy on the cards link that allows deleting the target of this link.

*dbschema/default.gel*

```sdl-diff
  module default {
+   type Card {
+     required order: int64;
+     required front: str;
+     required back: str;
+   };
+
+   type Deck {
+     required name: str;
+     description: str;
+     multi cards: Card {
+       constraint exclusive;
+       on target delete allow;
+     };
+   };
  };
```

Congratulations! This first version of the data model‚Äôs schema is stored in a file on disk. Now you need to signal the database to actually create types for Deck and Card in the database.

To make Gel do that, you need to do two quick steps:

```sh
$ npx gel migration create
Created ./dbschema/migrations/00001-m125ajr.edgeql, id: m125ajrbqp7ov36s7aniefxc376ofxdlketzspy4yddd3hrh4lxmla

Take a look at the schema you‚Äôve generated in the built-in database UI. Use this tool to visualize your data model and see the object types and links you‚Äôve defined.

```sh
$ npx gel ui
