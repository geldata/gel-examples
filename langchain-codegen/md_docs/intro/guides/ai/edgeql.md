# Gel AI in EdgeQL

Gel AI brings vector search capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation directly into the database.

## Enable and configure the extension

Now our Gel application can take advantage of OpenAI’s API to implement AI capabilities.

Gel AI comes with its own UI that can be used to configure providers, set up prompts and test them in a sandbox.

Most API providers require you to set up and account and charge money for model use.

## Add vectors and perform similarity search

## Use the built-in RAG

One more feature Gel AI offers is built-in retrieval-augmented generation, also known as RAG.

## Keep going!

You are now sufficiently equipped to use Gel AI in your applications.

If you’d like to build something on your own, make sure to check out the Reference manual in order to learn the details about using different APIs and models, configuring prompts or using the UI. Make sure to also check out the Gel AI bindings in Python and JavaScript if those languages are relevant to you.

And if you would like more guidance for how Gel AI can be fit into an application, take a look at the FastAPI Gel AI Tutorial, where we’re building a search bot using features you learned about above.
