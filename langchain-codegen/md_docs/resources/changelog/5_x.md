# v5.0

To play with the new features, make sure to specify version 5.0 when initializing the project as pre-release versions are not considered stable and will not be automatically suggested:

```bash
$ edgedb project init
```

## Upgrading

Local and Cloud instances

To upgrade a local project, first ensure that your CLI is up to date with edgedb cli upgrade. Then run the following command inside the project directory.

```bash
$ edgedb project upgrade
```

Alternatively, specify an instance name if you arenâ€™t using a project.

```bash
$ edgedb instance upgrade -I my_instance
```

The CLI will first check to see if your schema will migrate cleanly to EdgeDB 5.0. If the upgrade check finds any problems, it will report them back to you.

Hosted instances

To upgrade a remote (hosted) instance, we recommend the following dump-and-restore process.
