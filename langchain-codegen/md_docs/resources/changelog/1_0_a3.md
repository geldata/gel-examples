# 1.0 Alpha 3

This changelog summarizes new features and breaking changes in EdgeDB 1.0 alpha 3 “Proxima Centauri”.

## CLI

The EdgeDB command-line tools are now written in Rust. The tools are a single binary now and can run on multiple different platforms, including Windows.

A few more commands have been added to REPL:

```default
\dump FILENAME           dump current database into a file
\restore FILENAME        restore the database from file into
                         the current one
\s, \history             show history
\e, \edit [N]            spawn $EDITOR to edit history entry N
                         then use the output as the input
\set [OPTION [VALUE]]    show/change setting
\set                     Show setting descriptions (without
                         arguments)
```

Existing introspection commands have been slightly updated to use a different way of supplying command options. Commands now also have long-form names that are more human-readable.

Also, there are a few settings that control the look and feel of the REPL (and can be changed via the \set command:

```default
expand-strings             Stop escaping newlines in quoted
                           strings
implicit-properties        Print implicit properties of objects:
                           id, type id
input-mode                 Set input mode. One of: vi, emacs
introspect-types           Print type names instead of `Object`
                           in default output mode (may fail if
                           schema is updated after enabling
                           option)
limit                      Set implicit LIMIT. Defaults to 100,
                           specify 0 to disable
output-mode                Set output mode. One of: json, json-
                           elements, default, tab-separated
verbose-errors             Print all errors with maximum
                           verbosity
```
