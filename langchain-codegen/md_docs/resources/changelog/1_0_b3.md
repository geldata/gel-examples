# 1.0 Beta 3

This changelog summarizes new features and breaking changes in EdgeDB 1.0 beta 3 “Ross”.

## Migrations

We continue working on improving our schema and migration tools:

## EdgeQL

## GraphQL

## TLS

We’ve implemented RFC 1008: TLS and ALPN. With Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol enabled by default, it is possible to leverage the TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Extension for secure and reliable protocol selection on top of the TLS transport, allowing EdgeDB to multiplex different frontend protocols like the binary protocol and the HTTP-based protocol on the same port.

## Command-Line Tools

We’ve changed some of the CLI commands and groupings. There are some top-level “frequently used” commands such as gel dump, gel restore, gel migrate, gel query, gel info and gel cli upgrade. Other commands are grouped into categories: gel configure, gel migration, gel list, gel describe, gel instance, gel project and gel server.

Here’s a more comprehensive list of the CLI commands:
