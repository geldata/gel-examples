# v6.0

To explore the new features, ensure you specify version 6.0 when initializing your project. Pre-release versions are not considered stable and will not be automatically suggested:

```bash
$ gel project init --server-version 6.0-rc.2
```

## Upgrading

Local instances

To upgrade a local project, first ensure that your CLI is up to date with gel cli upgrade. Then run the following command inside the project directory.

```bash
$ gel project upgrade --to-testing
```

Alternatively, specify an instance name if you arenâ€™t using a project:

```bash
$ gel instance upgrade -I my_instance
```

The CLI will check if your schema can migrate cleanly to Gel 6.0. If any issues are found, they will be reported.

Hosted instances

To upgrade a remote instance, we recommend the following dump-and-restore process:

## New features

## Additional changes

## 6.1

## 6.2

## 6.3

## 6.4

## 6.5

## 6.6

Due to an error in our release infrastructure, 6.6 was inadvertently released from our master branch (commit 7db665af18d22d90d5ec682159353552c67ce1c5).

It has been removed from our package servers, and was never available in our cloud.

If you have a 6.6 instance, you will need to perform a dump and restore to upgrade to 6.7. We apologize for the inconvenience.

## 6.7
