# 1.0 Alpha 2

This changelog summarizes new features and breaking changes in EdgeDB 1.0 alpha 2.

## New JavaScript Driver

EdgeDB has a new high-performance native EdgeDB driver for NodeJS 10+.

The driver is written in strict TypeScript, thoroughly tested, and has first-class async/await support.  It is at least twice as efficient as comparable current PostgreSQL JavaScript drivers.

Install it with npm or yarn:

```bash
$ npm install gel
```

and it is ready for use:

```javascript
const edgedb = require("edgedb");

async function main() {
  const conn = await edgedb.connect({
    user: "edgedb",
    host: "127.0.0.1",
  });

  try {
    console.log(await conn.fetchOne("select 1 + 1"));
  } finally {
    await conn.close();
  }
}

main();
```

The documentation can be found here.

## Standard Library

## Dump / Restore

The new edgedb dump and edgedb restore commands can be used to safely dump and restore EdgeDB databases, including when upgrading to new versions of EdgeDB.

## EdgeQL

## GraphQL

## DDL / SDL / Schema

DDL and SDL layers are heavily refactored in alpha 2. A lot of issues were fixed; this section lists only new features and backwards incompatible changes:

## Introspection

## REPL

## Server

## Misc
