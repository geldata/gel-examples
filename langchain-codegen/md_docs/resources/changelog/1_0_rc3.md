# 1.0 RC 3

This changelog summarizes changes and bugfixes in EdgeDB 1.0 Release Candidate 3 “Cygni”. This release is focusing on fixing existing issues rather than introducing new features.

## Packaging

The biggest change in this release is in how EdgeDB is packaged. We now have a “portable build” that runs on any non-legacy Linux or macOS system. The purpose is to avoid restrictions that supporting native packaging systems imposes. Because of this we recommend a more explicit dump/restore upgrade workflow to get your instances to RC3.

Before you start you may want to backup the instance credentials (which you can find in the “Config” directory indicated by gel info). The first step in the upgrade process will be backing up all the instance data and that will include the login credentials that the instance expects. After restoring the database dump, you may need to restore old credentials file as well.

## EdgeQL

## Bindings

We are in the process of dropping old deprecated APIs before rolling out production-ready EdgeDB.
