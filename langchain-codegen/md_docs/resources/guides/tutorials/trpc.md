# tRPC

This guide explains how to integrate Gel with tRPC for a modern, type-safe API. We’ll cover setting up database interactions, API routing, and implementing authentication, all while ensuring type safety across the client and server.

You can reference the following repositories for more context:

## Step 1: Gel setup

Gel will serve as the database layer for your application.

## Step 2: Configure Gel Client

To interact with Gel from your application, you need to configure the client.

## Step 3: tRPC setup

tRPC enables type-safe communication between the frontend and backend.

## Step 4: Use tRPC Client

Now that the server is set up, you can use the tRPC client to interact with the API from the frontend. We will demonstrate how to integrate tRPC with Next.js and Express.

## Step 5: Set up authentication with Gel Auth

In this section, we will cover how to integrate Gel Auth with tRPC and context in both Next.js and Express environments. This will ensure that user authentication is handled securely and that both server-side and client-side tRPC calls can access the user’s session.
