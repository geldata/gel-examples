# Contributing

Gel is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from our community. You can contribute by writing code or by helping us improve our documentation.

To make sure the project can continue to improve quickly, we have a few guidelines designed to make it easier for your contributions to make it into the project. General guidelines are presented here. You will find guidelines relevant only to code or documentation in those sections of the guide.

These are guidelines rather than hard rules. If you want to submit a pull request that strays from these, it might be a good idea to start a discussion about it first. Otherwise, it’s possible your pull request might not be merged.

## General Guidelines

## Thank You!
