# DigitalOcean

In this guide we show how to deploy Gel to DigitalOcean either with a One-click Deploy option or a managed PostgreSQL database as the backend.

Gel Cloud: The easiest way to run Gel Gel Cloud is the official hosted service managed by the Gel team, offering the simplest and most reliable way to run Gel in production. While self-hosting is possible (as shown in these guides), Gel Cloud provides a seamlessly integrated experience with perfect compatibility between local development and production environments. It includes a generous free tier, Vercel and GitHub (deploy previews work out of the box), a hosted UI, and using it directly supports the development of Gel itself!
