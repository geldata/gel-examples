# Branches

Gel’s branches are equivalent to PostgreSQL’s databases and map to them directly. Gel comes with tooling to help manage branches and build a development workflow around them. E.g. when developing locally you can map your Gel branches to your Git branches, and when using Gel Cloud and GitHub you can have a branch per PR.

## CLI commands

Refer to the gel branch command group for details on the CLI commands for managing branches.

## DDL commands

These are low-level commands that are used to create, alter, and drop branches. You can use them when experimenting in REPL, of if you want to create your own tools to manage Gel branches.

## Database (deprecated)

Versions of Gel prior to 5.0 used the term database to refer to branches.
