# Link properties

Links, like objects, can also contain properties. These are used to store metadata about the link. Due to how they’re persisted under the hood, link properties have a few additional constraints: they’re always single and optional.

Link properties require non-trivial syntax to use them, so they are considered to be an advanced feature. In many cases, regular properties should be used instead. To paraphrase a famous quote: “Link properties are like a parachute, you don’t need them very often, but when you do, they can be clutch.”

In practice, link properties are best used with many-to-many relationships (multi links without any exclusive constraints). For one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one relationships the same data should be stored in object properties instead.

## Declaration

Let’s a create a Person.friends link with a strength property corresponding to the strength of the friendship.

```sdl
type Person {
  required name: str { constraint exclusive };

  multi friends: Person {
    strength: float64;
  }
}
```

## Constraints

Now let’s ensure that the @strength property is always non-negative:

```sdl
type Person {
  required name: str { constraint exclusive };

  multi friends: Person {
    strength: float64;

    constraint expression on (
      __subject__@strength >= 0
    );
  }
}
```

## Indexes

To add an index on a link property, we have to refactor our code and define an abstract link friendship that will contain the strength property with an index on it:

```sdl
abstract link friendship {
  strength: float64;
  index on (__subject__@strength);
}

type Person {
  required name: str { constraint exclusive };

  multi friends: Person {
    extending friendship;
  };
}
```

## Conceptualizing link properties

A way to conceptualize the difference between a regular property and a link property is that regular properties are used to construct an object, while link properties are used to construct the link between objects.

For example, here the name and email properties are used to construct a Person object:

```edgeql
insert Person {
  name := "Jane",
  email := "jane@jane.com"
}
```

Now let’s insert a Person object linking it to another Person object setting the @strength property to the link between them:

```edgeql
insert Person {
  name := "Bob",
  email := "bob@bob.com",
  friends := (
    insert Person {
      name := "Jane",
      email := "jane@jane.com",
      @strength := 3.14
    }
  )
}
```

So we’re not using @strength to construct a particular Person object, but to quantify a link between two Person objects.

## Inserting

What if we want to insert a Person object while linking it to another Person that’s already in the database?

The @strength property then will be specified in the shape of a select subquery:

```edgeql
insert Person {
  name := "Bob",
  friends := (
    select detached Person {
      @strength := 3.14
    }
    filter .name = "Alice"
  )
}
```

We are using the detached operator to unbind the Person reference from the scope of the insert query.

When doing a nested insert, link properties can be directly included in the inner insert subquery:

```edgeql
insert Person {
  name := "Bob",
  friends := (
    insert Person {
      name := "Jane",
      @strength := 3.14
    }
  )
}
```

Similarly, with can be used to capture an expression returning an object type, after which a link property can be added when linking it to another object type:

```edgeql
with
  alice := (

    insert Person {
      name := "Alice"
    }
    unless conflict on .name
    else (
      select Person
      filter .name = "Alice" limit 1
    )
  )

insert Person {
  name := "Bob",
  friends := alice {
    @strength := 3.14
  }
};
```

## Updating

```edgeql
update Person
filter .name = "Bob"
set {
  friends += (
    select .friends {
      @strength := 3.7
    }
    filter .name = "Alice"
  )
};
```

The example updates the @strength property of Bob’s friends link to Alice to 3.7.

In the context of multi links the += operator works like an an insert/update operator.

To update one or more links in a multi link, you can select from the current linked objects, as the example does. Use a detached selection if you want to insert/update a wider selection of linked objects instead.

## Selecting

To select a link property, you can use the @<>name syntax inside the select shape. Keep in mind, that you’re not selecting a property on an object with this syntax, but rather on the link, in this case friends:

```edgeql-repl
gel> select Person {
....   name,
....   friends: {
....     name,
....     @strength
....   }
.... };
{
  default::Person {name: 'Alice', friends: {}},
  default::Person {
    name: 'Bob',
    friends: {
      default::Person {name: 'Alice', @strength: 3.7}
    }
  },
}
```

## Unions

A link property cannot be referenced in a set union except in the case of a for loop. That means this will not work:

```edgeql
# 🚫 Does not work
insert Movie {
  title := 'The Incredible Hulk',
  actors := {(
    select Person {
      @character_name := 'The Hulk'
    } filter .name = 'Mark Ruffalo'
  ),
  (
    select Person {
      @character_name := 'Iron Man'
    } filter .name = 'Robert Downey Jr.'
  )}
};
```

That query will produce an error: QueryError: invalid reference to link property in top level shape

You can use this workaround instead:

```edgeql
# ✅ Works!
insert Movie {
  title := 'The Incredible Hulk',

  actors := assert_distinct((
    with characters := {
      ('The Hulk', 'Mark Ruffalo'),
      ('Iron Man', 'Robert Downey Jr.')
    }
    for character in characters union (
        select Person {
            @character_name := character.0
        } filter .name = character.1
    )
  ))
};
```

Note that we are also required to wrap the actors query with assert_distinct() here to assure the compiler that the result set is distinct.

## With computed backlinks

Specifying link properties of a computed backlink in your shape is also supported. If you have this schema:

```sdl
type Person {
  required name: str;

  multi follows: Person {
    followed: datetime {
      default := datetime_of_statement();
    };
  };

  multi link followers := .<follows[is Person];
}
```

this query will work as expected:

```edgeql
select Person {
  name,

  followers: {
    name,
    @followed
  }
};
```

even though @followed is a link property of follows and we are accessing is through the computed backlink followers instead.
