# Standard Library

Gel comes with a rigorously defined type system consisting of scalar types, collection types (like arrays and tuples), and object types. There is also a library of built-in functions and operators for working with each datatype.

## Scalar Types

Scalar types store primitive data.

## Collection Types

Collection types are special generic types used to group homogeneous or heterogeneous data.

## Range Types

## Object Types
