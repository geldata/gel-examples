# Query Builder Generator

## Overview

The Gel query builder provides a code-first way to write fully-typed EdgeQL queries with TypeScript. Unlike traditional ORMs that offer a limited set of operations, the query builder leverages EdgeQLâ€™s composable nature, allowing developers to dynamically construct complex queries by combining expressions. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where queries need to change dynamically at runtime. Even for static queries, the query builder offers the benefits of type safety and autocompletion, helping you write correct queries with confidence while maintaining the full expressiveness of EdgeQL.
